- If asked to debug the build script, run it yourself, find the issue, and fix it.
- Metal migration scope (current round): achieve full functional parity Metal graphics backend for macOS; not an MVP-only target.
- For now, keep OpenGL/Vulkan sources in repo but make macOS runtime/build use Metal only.
- During this migration, avoid making any git commits; temporary non-runnable intermediate code is acceptable as long as final state builds/runs on macOS Tahoe.
- User decision (2026-02-10): prioritize completing the port first; defer memory optimization and return to it later.
- User preference (2026-02-10): use `apply_patch` for `.agents/*` file edits instead of direct shell/heredoc writes.
- User preference (2026-02-11): unless explicitly requested, do not include OpenGL in the macOS build/runtime path; keep macOS on Metal.
- User expectation (2026-02-11): logs should include a full software state snapshot every second, and any error/fatal error must be logged immediately.
- User preference (2026-02-11): prefer the existing baseline logging method over ad-hoc visualization-targeted logging instrumentation.
